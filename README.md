# Parsing-musical-frequency-signatures
This project uses the Gabor Transform to isolate and reconstruct different instruments from a sound clip of 'I'm Shipping Up to Boston' by Dropkick Murphys. By analyzing frequencies over time and creating spectrograms, the drum, electric-guitar, and banjo are isolated based on their specific frequencies.

    <h1>Decomposing Music</h1>
    <p>Please use the sample code CP2_sample.m to read in the sound clip CP2_SoundClip.mat. If you’re using Python, we’ll have a translation of it in the template, although presumably it’s not too different from MATLAB. Since MATLAB is available to all students, it might be best to run the MATLAB sample code just to hear it and see the signal.</p>
    <p>In the project we will try to isolate and reconstruct instrument types from the clip. The nice thing about this particular song is that the instruments are introduced one at a time, so that should help isolate the frequency signatures.</p>

      <li>Through the use of the Gabor transform we used in class create a spectrogram and study the frequencies from the sound clip.</li>
      <li>Isolate the baseline/drumbeats (in one sound clip and its associated signal plot).</li>
      <li>Isolate the guitar and other similar string instruments similar to how you isolated the baseline.</li>
