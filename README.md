# Parsing-musical-frequency-signatures
This project uses the Gabor Transform to isolate and reconstruct different instruments from a sound clip of 'I'm Shipping Up to Boston' by Dropkick Murphys. By analyzing frequencies over time and creating spectrograms, the drum, electric-guitar, and banjo are isolated based on their specific frequencies.
